The code includes the necessary header file stdio.h for input/output operations.

Three functions are defined:

Square(int x) takes an integer x as input and returns the square of x by multiplying it with itself.

SquareOfSum(int x, int y) takes two integers x and y as input, adds them together, and then returns the square of their sum by calling the Square function.

total(int a, int b) takes two integers a and b as input and returns the square of their sum by calling the SquareOfSum function.

In the main function:

Two integer variables a and b are declared and initialized with the values 4 and 8, respectively.

The total function is called with a and b as arguments, and the result is stored in the result variable.

Finally, the printf function is used to display the output by printing the value of result along with the text "output = ".

When you run this code, it will calculate the square of the sum of a and b using the total function. In this case, a is 4, b is 8, so the sum is 12, and the square of 12 is 144.
